Boulder Blitz

To do:
	Add colour switching
	Rubble cloud on collision; beg for universal direction (ezpz) or make directional rubble (!ezpz)
	Make dead player on game finish, remove queue_free() for locking input and just display crumbled rocks
	Consider adding player to player grapple and slingshot connection -- Very buggy
	Consider removing dot product based damage entirely, maybe. Seems to be more consistent
	Consider replacing Map 3 for something else (sorry noah)
	Add health regain ability, have to stand still to use


Current issues:
	Grapple clips players through walls when too short # Disconnect at min_grapple_dist, like slingshot? Works to prevent clipping, not teleporting though


Meta builds:
	Map 1:
	
	Map 2:
	
	Map 3:
		AB-5, # Slingshot
		AB-3, # Frictionless
		AB-6 # Spikes
