Boulder Blitz

to do:
	Add colour switching
	Rubble cloud on collision; beg for universal direction (ezpz) or make directional rubble (!ezpz)
	Make dead player on game finish, remove queue_free() for locking input and just display crumbled rocks
	Visual indicators for collision point for grapple & slingshot
	Finish moving platform attachment (can't handle fast movement and forces player thru walls sometimes)
	Consider removing dot product based damage entirely, feels a bit inconsistent
	Consider replacing Map 3 for something else (sorry noah)


Map 3 meta build:
	AB-5, # Slingshot
	AB-3, # Frictionless
	AB-2 # V Dash
